# nim nighty build for newcomers 
 - It is for a newcomer like me :) .
 - Nim with 'spacemacs' is a good combination for me.

## to start nim nighty build within a hour:
```
git clone https://github.com/kmry/nim_nighty_space
cd nim_nighty_space
make Nim
```

Then your C compiler(eg.gcc) will start to compile nim nighty build(a.k.a nim 0.17.3, on Feb. 2018).

## After building a nighty version nim...:
Pls. see 'Makefile' to see how to do next.

## if you need a temporal but good editor for nim:
Try 'spacemacs' with some basic settings.
It is not difficult to start 'spacemacs'.
